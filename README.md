  This paper describes LS/ATN, Living SystemsÂ®Adaptive Transportation bus, an agent-based solution we have developed to solve transportation problems in the charter business logistics. LS/ATN provides automatic optimization and execution capabilities that extend the existing planning systems accordingly. To describe our solution and analyse its performance, we report on a real case scenario in which transportation requests of a big logistics provider were optimized. Besides describing the agent approach and the LS/ATN features we stress the necessity to integrate such agent system into a real-world IT architecture. Finally, we show that our adaptive solution produces significantly better results in real case scenarios than what achieved with manual optimization of professional dispatchers.
